Markov chain is a stochastic process in which the current state depends on the previous state, which means that the probability of a new state is dependent only on the current state and is not affected by previous states.

In a Markov chain model, the current state is usually represented by a given state. For example, in a chess game, the current state is determined by the position of the pieces on the board and the conditions for moving them. Each new move is predicted by a Markov chain and is known as a Markov chain due to its dependence on the previous state.

Markov Chain is used in many different applications, including natural language processing, neural networks, economic systems analysis, social networks, etc. In some cases, Markov chain models are optimized and improved using statistical algorithms such as Monte Carlo algorithm.
